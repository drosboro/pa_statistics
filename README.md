# PA Statistics

This is a collection of scripts I use to help manage student data and calculate various statistics.  They are likely of little value to anyone outside of our organization.

## Fall



## Winter

`calc_gg_award.R`: Given last year's final marks, calculates average percentages and ranks students for Governer General Award.

## Spring

`overall_average_percentage.R`: given Semester 1 and Term 3 grades, calculates overall average percentage (GPA) for students.  Used for providing data for scholarship awards.

## Summer

`combine_absence_counts.R`: merges four separate attendance exports from PCR into a single table, and calculates per-term averages for each type of attendance record.

`analysis.Rmd`: given each year's IB stats report (downloaded as a CSV from IBIS), calculates and graphs a variety of descriptive statistics to compare this year's results to historical averages.
